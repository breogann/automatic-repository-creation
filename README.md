# Starting off a python data science project on GitHub

## Automatize repository creation and the set up of your work environment with this simple bash script

Clone the repo or download the bash script. Then just use this command by passing two arguments: your GitHub user & the name of your new repo.

```bash
bash repo.sh your_github_username new_repo
```

And that's it! You're ready to code ðŸš€
